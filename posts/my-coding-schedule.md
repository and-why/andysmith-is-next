I wake up at around 6am, on the odd occasion that I have a bad night's sleep, I'll sometimes let this slip to 6:45 - 7am. I don't actually set an alarm, as I'm a pretty natural early riser these days, probably from all those early 5am mornings as a cyclist. I find 7am to be quite the lazy lie in. I like waking naturally when my body tells me to, and because I don't sleep past 7am, ever, I was never late to work or anything.   

The first thing I do is drink some water, and go make a coffee. Then I head to my work station to begin. Usually I'm starting by 6:30am. 

I'll first crack open HackerRank to do some practice. I was using CodeWars for this first hour or so doing their challenges. These help me refine my understanding of JavaScript and algorithms. I moved to HackerRank as I was told this has more opportunity for employment down the line. I do like the CodeWar Katas, so I will probably switch between them when I have done a bit on HackerRank.

I walk the dogs in the morning every other day, and the evening every other day. If I'm on morning duty like today, I will walk the dogs at around 7:45-8. Usually getting at least 1 hour of practice in before that. They get a nice run at the local cricket oval and then back for breakfast at 8:45.

I've been having a nice mushroom, spinach and tomato mixture on toast for breakfast. Yes, the same thing every day - the less decisions I have to make the better, as I'm already deciding on my own curriculum. I've been trying to cut down on animal products, not totally vegan or even vegetarian, but a huge shift means I'm putting less pressure on the industry. I think that's more sustainable than expecting everyone to go vegan. Anyway, this isn't a blog post on that.

At 9am, I get back to work. If I haven't walked the dogs, I'll often still stop for breakfast at 8:45am but having done an extra 45-1 hour practice.

At 9am, I will look to some educational material, over the last week I have been reading JustJavasctipt.com from Dan Abramov, it's really good at helping to build a mental modal of JavaScript. Nothing overly new, but really just understanding it a lot better. Previously I have also used a couple of Udemy courses on Next.js and React, and will start on a new Advanced React course covering GraphQL also, which should be fun. The way I like to do these courses is not to follow them exactly, but to take what they teach and apply it to a different scenario, this way I learn by figuring out the bits that don't align exactly. I'll do this until lunch, which I like to take at 12pm. 

I also like take breaks through the day and have started doing a little micro workout. I do 33 pushups, 33 sqats, 33 sit-ups, 33 bridges and 33 rows with bands. I try to do this 3 times a day, 10:30am, 11:55am and 2:30pm. 

I take a quick 15 minute lunch most days, and then get back to it. For the afternoon, I work on a project of my own. Either this website, write a blog post, or work on a coding project. At the moment I've been working on a kind of Airbnb clone, but using a hotel API to pull the listings and not have the hosting side of their business. I don't want to spend too much time thinking about design, so mostly copied and tweaked theirs and some other hotel booking websites. You can find this at https://sonderescapes.vercel.com. I find working on my own projects a time I can continue to work with the technologies I've previously learned. So, if I learned something a little while ago, like Firebase or Next.js, I can continue to work with them so that I can solidify my understanding, whilst also learning something new in the morning.

I'll work on this until about 5pm, when I like to call it a day. In total, I get around 8-9 hours of solid coding and learning in. I'll also often do half a day over the weekend, usually on more of the fun stuff like my own projects as it's then not too much like education, but still learning a lot.
