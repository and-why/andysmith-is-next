I've hit the 50 days of code. As I mentioned in the previous post, it hasn't been every day for 50 days, as I've had most weekends to myself. I'm maintaining around 6+ hours per day during the week, so making a lot of progress. I also haven't committed to Github (the image) every day, even those days I did code I didn't always commit, as there was nothing to commit. 

Over the last few days I had been finding myself wanting to build the frontend (website/client facing part) to a lot of the Python projects I've been building. Whether that is because I am more comfortable in the frontend or because it feels more complete, or I like the mix of design/build I'm not sure. But I seem to always gravitate to this kind of dev work. I don't want to focus solely on websites, and certainly not on simple WordPress or static websites. I know that much from my freelance life, but I am thinking I'd enjoy building progressive web apps and websites built in that manner would be a lot of fun.

I have a lot of experience with HTML/CSS and some previous experience with a JavaScript Library called ReactJS. There are also a lot of opportunities out there and you don't need a Computer Science degree to get one of these jobs, which from some random searches I've been doing, Python jobs are looking more on that angle. 

So I have spent the last couple of days refreshing my knowledge of ReactJS and actually learning hooks, as these were only just being released when I put a hold on my coding. I've been really enjoying it. And can see a pretty good future here. 

I have also started looking at the NextJS framework, which is built upon React. I touched it briefly a few years ago, and it just feels like they 'completed' React in regards to the actual building of apps. I really like the vibe of the Vercel company (who built and maintain NextJS). 

So for the next 50 days I am going to mostly focus on this side of the world. Python has taught me a lot, and I will continue that course maybe 1 or 2 days per week, but the main focus will be Frontend now. 

It's obviously not the actual half way in learning though, I have a long way to go before I'm comfortable looking for jobs. But I'm hoping by the end of this course I can start building some frontends for the Python projects I have or just building some really cool stuff and use that to leverage myself into a job. Or who knows, maybe I can come up with an idea and build something that earns me some money. I'm excited about this next 50 days.
